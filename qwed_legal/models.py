"""
QWED-Legal shared verification models.

VerificationStep is the atomic unit of a verification_trace — a structured,
auditable record of every decision made during a guard's verification run.

Key distinction:
  - verification_trace is NOT a narrative explanation.
  - Each step has an evidence_type that explicitly classifies HOW the output
    was derived: DETERMINISTIC, PARSED, INFERRED, HEURISTIC, or UNSUPPORTED.
  - A step with evidence_type=PARSED is NOT proof. It means "we read/matched
    this from structure" — authority or correctness is not claimed.
  - Only DETERMINISTIC steps represent actual mathematical/logical proof.
